                        <p>Over the last couple of years, we have developed a very accurate method of data mining that allows
                            significantly improving the quality of collected HR data as well as the expanding the scope of the
                            analytics, which serve as your KPIs.</p>
                        <p>The biggest problem of the present-day HR is the lack of high quality and accurate data. Another complication
                            is how to migrate large amounts of the data into the cloud storage. What's also possible is that you already
                            have cloud based data but have hard time accessing it or your in-house team might be lacking some knowledge
